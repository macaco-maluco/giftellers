# Gifteller

Inspired on Dixit, Giftellers is a spin on the classic card game. Using a deck of GIF cards, players select cards that match a title suggested by the 'storyteller' then latter attempt to guess which card the 'storyteller' selected.

Giftellers is to be played with a TV (big screen) and smartphones (3 people minimum) with people in the same room.

## Game play

You can start by checking the landing page to review how the game works:

http://giftellers.macacomaluco.space

Then open the Big screen app:

http://giftellers.macacomaluco.space/big-screen.html

Get at least 3 friends (or three browser tabs if you are lonely) joining via the remote app:

http://giftellers.macacomaluco.space/player.html

Awesome! The first player to join will be the game LEADER. The leader's responsibility is to move the game forward. This is a game to be played in the same room, so read the instructions as presented in the Big Screen, interact with your friends asking them to perform their actions and move the game to the next step. (The leader never changes until the game is over)

Once per turn a new Storyteller will be assigned and his role is to choose a GIF from his "hand", and put together a sentence or phrase that might describe it to the other players. This sentence is to be said out loud! Remember you are in the same room.

The other players role at this point is to try to select a GIF that best fits the Storyteller's description. Once everyone is ready the voting begins.

The scoring logic is:

For the storyteller:

- Get 3 points if at least one but not all players have guessed his GIF.

For the players:

- Get 3 points for guessing the Storyteller's GIF correctly;
- Get 1 point for each other player that selected his GIF.

The game ends once anyone reaches the end in the score table (20 points).

Have fun!
